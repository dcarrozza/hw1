      After the wedding came the honeymoon.  We spent a week in Moorea, French Polynesia at the Hilton Moorea Lagoon Resort
      and Spa. During that time we were lucky enough to call one of the overwater bungalows home. The views were spectacular,
      the snorkeling was unreal, and the relaxation was without comparison.  Not a bad way to start married life!
