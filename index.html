      Hi everyone, I'm Dustin. And thanks to my lack of creativity, this website is going to be all about me.  I had a great
      year in <span class="date">2017</span>, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Getting married in Chicago </li>
      <li> Honeymooning in Moorea </li>
      <li> Beginning my MBA studies at Kellogg </li>
      <li> Attending a best friend's wedding </li>
      <li> Vacationing in Panama </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Eventually I'll get around to telling you about all of them.  For now, check out the links below to learn more
      about the most life changing one.
